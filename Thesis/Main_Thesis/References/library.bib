abstract = {The information of the road grade plays an important role in improving the ride comfort and fuel consumption. This paper proposes a Quaternion Unscented Kalman Filter (QUKF) to estimate the road grade accurately, which needs only measurements from low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The model is built based on the data from accelerometer and gyroscope. The quaternion, which represents orientations and rotations, is chosen to be the state variables, while the three-axle acceleration is set as measurement vector. The proposed observer is tested and verified using the simulation software CarSim and MATLAB Simulink under several scenarios. To compare the performance of the algorithm, the Kalman filter and complementary filter are also implemented under the same simulation conditions. The results illustrate that the presented observer improves the accuracy and stability. Finally, the results of experiments are delivered and the performance of the filter is assessed against the output of a complete GPS/INS available in the same real-world dataset.},

abstract = {Inertial sensors based on MEMS technology are fast becoming ubiquitous with their adoption into many types of consumer electronics products, including smart phones, tablets, gaming systems, TV remotes, toys, and even (more recently) power tools and wearable sensors. Now a standard feature of most smart phones, MEMS-based motion tracking enhances the user interface by allowing response to user motions, complements the GPS receiver by providing dead-reckoning indoor navigation and supporting location-based services, and holds the promise of enabling handset optical image stabilization in next-generation handsets by virtue of its lower cost and small form factor. This tutorial provides an overview of MEMS technology and describes the essential features of the mechanical systems underlying the most common sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes. It also highlights some fundamental trade-offs related to mechanical system dynamics, force and charge transduction methods, and their implications for the mixed-signal systems that process the sensor outputs. The presentation of an energy-based metric allows a comparison of the performance of competing sensor solutions. For each type of sensor, descriptions of the underlying mechanical theory, canonical sensor architectures, and key design challenges are also presented. Finally, the tutorial reviews multisensor silicon MEMS/CMOS monolithic integration, which is driving the cost and form factor reduction behind the current proliferation of these devices. {\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The information of the road grade is an important input for advanced driver assistance systems to improve the vehicle ride comfort, safety, and fuel consumption. Current approaches for road grade estimation in the literature have various disadvantages, e.g., they lack in resolution and sample rate or use data from a lot of sensors, often not from series production. This paper presents methods, which are based on filters that combine the measurements from an inexpensive gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer to estimate the orientation of the sensor relative to the earth's surface. The methods are evaluated using high-resolution road grade data as reference, which were acquired with an aircraft and the light detection and ranging technique. The road grade information, calculated in the vehicle in real-time, could be transmitted to a central database and merged with information of other vehicles. Therefore, digital maps for advanced driver assistance systems could be kept updated in very short intervals with high-resolution road grade information.},

abstract = {3D mapping is increasingly important for mobile robotics in general and for Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR) in particular as complex environments must but captured in this domain. But it is hard to visualize 3D data in a simple way, e.g. to print maps for first responders, or to use it in standard robotics algorithms, e.g., for path planning. This paper describes a new approach to extract standard planar maps from large scale 3D maps in a very fast manner. In doing so, the approach can detect multiple floors, e.g., in a multi-story building or in a pancake collapse, and segment the 3D map accordingly. To each floor or level, a planar map is assigned, which is augmented by semantic information, especially with respect to traversability. Experiments are presented that are based on 3D maps generated in the large scale environments of USARsim, a high fidelity robot simulator. It is shown that the approach is very fast. The total processing of a complete 3D map takes just a few hundred milliseconds, leading to a proper extraction of floor plans to each of which semantic maps are assigned.},

We show that, in the presence of two cameras aligned to the same orientation, it is possible to compute the normal vector to a plane by using only three corresponding points whereas with traditional methods this computation requires at least four points and the decomposition of the homography matrix. We obtain the triangulation of the set of features and we compute for every triangle its normal vector. By grouping adjacent triangles with equal normal we are able to select all the points belonging to the same plane. The method does not require any information about the camera calibration or the camera relative translation.

abstract = {Multi-level road junctions are becoming increasingly popular in several major cities. In order to cope with such scenarios, car navigation systems require positioning units to supply accurate slope information. This knowledge allows correct matching to one of the options available from 3D maps. For cost reasons, slope needs to be obtained using consumer-grade MEMS IMUs. One method to assess the vehicle pitch angle, is using accelerometer, although the contributions of gravity and motion need to be separated from its output. This compensation procedure, in land vehicle applications, is possible when unit is connected to vehicle (e.g. via CAN bus); in such a way motion information can be obtained and removed from the raw accelerometer measurements. These measurements, even when calibrated and motion-compensated, are affected by issues such as noise (vibrations, quantization and differentiation), biases due to lever arm between wheels and sensor, IMU cross axis effects, etc. These issues prevent accelerometer-only slope estimation to reach acceptable performance in multilevel navigation scenarios. In order to overcome them, this research work proposes to use gyroscope observables to complement the accelerometer in the pitch estimation algorithm. The gyroscope provides relative angle measurements, with the advantage of being very accurate on high frequencies, while drifting with time due to integration of biases. The accelerometer, instead, is typically subject to large errors at high frequencies. The two sensors observables have been merged into an innovative sensor fusion algorithm, based on two cascaded Kalman filters, in addition to the GNSS receiver data. The first one exploits GNSS PVT Outputs (e.g. altitude and vertical velocity) and car travelled path information, in order to calibrate and motion-compensate the accelerometer output. It provides also a smoothed, GNSS independent altitude estimation. The second one takes as input the raw slopes output from the first stage and performs fusion with the gyroscope signals. This stage also estimates the gyroscope calibration parameters. Algorithms have been designed and modelled in MATLAB™, validated on real field data acquired through a sensor logging equipment featuring a commercial GNSS receiver, a consumer-grade 6 axis IMU and a pressure sensor. The barometer measurements are not yet used in the sensor fusion algorithm, instead are fed to an alternative post processing method (also described in this work) providing a robust reference for validation. Simulation results confirms that the estimated slope is sufficiently smooth and accurate for multilevel junction navigation. This new algorithm overcomes the limitations of accelerometer-only architectures and constitutes an important building block for performance improvements of attitude and heading reference systems in automotive contexts. It could also be the basis for the development of a fully inertial navigation system. Future developments include the integration of the barometric information in the real time sensor fusion algorithm and extension to the other attitude angles.},

abstract = {Although road geometry data can be automatically collected using instruments mounted on survey vehicle, measurement of curved ramp geometry is still of low effectiveness and accuracy due to manual or semi-automatic detection of PC (Point of Curvature)/PT (Point of Tangent) as well as influences of vehicle vibration and wandering. In this study a new method is presented for automatic measurement of ramp geometry in network level using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and 3D LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) system. Firstly, horizontal alignment measurements are implemented: 1) an improved K-Mean clustering method and linear fitting method are integrated for automatic PC/PT station detection; 2) an algorithm is developed for automatic lane marking identification and localization for vehicle's trajectory calibration; 3) curve radius and length are measured based on roadway centerline. Subsequently, pavement slope is calibrated using IMU and transverse profiling data. Finally, nine segments are chosen from highway ramps as test bed, and validation tests are conducted using the field measurement. The test results show the average errors for curve detection and curve radius measurement are 5.89% and 1.99% respectively, and the P-value for longitudinal and cross slope measurement are 0.621 and 0.989 respectively, which indicate the proposed method is robust in ramp geometry measurement. The significant of the proposed method is three folds. First, it integrates and synchronizes the IMU and 3D LiDAR system in geometry measurement. Second, it solves the common problems of mobile survey on vehicle wandering and vibration. Third, it is of high accuracy and effectiveness, and can be used for roadway survey in network level.},

Kinematic Kalman filters that are independent of uncertain vehicle parameters integrate the inertial sensors with GPS to provide high update estimates of the vehicle states and the sensor biases. Using a twoantenna GPS system, the effects of pitch and roll on the measurements can be quantified and are demonstrated to be quite significant in sideslip angle estimation. Employing the same GPS system as an input to the estimator, this paper develops a method that compensates for roll and pitch effects to improve the accuracy of the vehicle state and sensor bias estimates. In addition, calibration procedures for the sensitivity and cross-coupling of inertial sensors are provided to further reduce measurement error. The resulting state estimates compare well to the results from calibrated models and Kalman filter predictions and are clean enough to use in vehicle dynamics control systems without additional filtering.},

abstract = {Dynamic vehicle loads play critical roles for automotive controls including battery management, transmission shift scheduling, distance-to-empty predictions, and various active safety systems. Accurate real-time estimation of vehicle loads such as those due to vehicle mass and road grade can thus improve safety, efficiency, and performance. While several estimation methods have been proposed in literature, none have seen widespread adoption in current vehicle technologies despite their potential to significantly improve automotive controls. To understand and bridge the gap between research development and wider adoption of real-time load estimation, this paper assesses the accuracy and performance of four estimation methods that predict vehicle mass and/or road grade. These include recursive least squares (RLS) with multiple forgetting factors; extended Kalman filtering (EKF); a dynamic grade observer (DGO); and a method developed by this research: parallel mass and grade (PMG) estimation using a longitudinal accelerometer. The estimation methods and models were constructed, numerous vehicle tests were performed, and data was evaluated off-line by the estimation approaches. It is found that RLS and EKF yield estimates within 5% of their actual values if provided initial values close to true initial states. To improve estimation when inaccurate initial values are provided, a mass selection algorithm is proposed that determines mass based on converged values from concurrently-operating EKF estimators. Its potential for accurate mass and grade estimation is demonstrated. PMG estimation provides the most reliable and accurate results, and demonstrates the greatest potential for successful real-time implementation to advance the performance, economy, and reliability of future vehicle controls.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel quaternion-based attitude estimator with magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays. A new structure of a fixed-gain complementary filter is designed fusing related sensors. To avoid using iterative algorithms, the accelerometer-based attitude determination is transformed into a linear system. Stable solution to this system is obtained via control theory. With only one matrix multiplication, the solution can be computed. Using the increment of the solution, we design a complementary filter that fuses gyroscope and accelerometer together. The proposed filter is fast, since it is free of iteration. We name the proposed filter the fast complementary filter (FCF). To decrease significant effects of unknown magnetic distortion imposing on the magnetometer, a stepwise filtering architecture is designed. The magnetic output is fused with the estimated gravity from gyroscope and accelerometer using a second complementary filter when there is no significant magnetic distortion. Several experiments are carried out on real hardware to show the performance and some comparisons. Results show that the proposed FCF can reach the accuracy of Kalman filter. It successfully finds a balance between estimation accuracy and time consumption. Compared with iterative methods, the proposed FCF has much less convergence speed. Besides, it is shown that the magnetic distortion would not affect the estimated Euler angles.},

abstract = {The market for high-performance inertial sensors, tactical grade and above, has been dominated to date by macro-scale devices such as HRGs, RLGs and FOGs. While the size, power requirements, and cost of these sensors have decreased considerably over the past two decades and further reductions can be expected, the tactical IMU size remains on the order of 0.5l, and the cost remains in the $10k range. During the same period, micro-scale inertial sensors based on MEMS technology have been introduced for automotive and consumer electronics applications and are now produced at the rate of several million per day. MEMS IMUs have become truly ubiquitous, however they have so far fallen short of the requirements for high-performance applications. Nevertheless, there have been continuing reductions in their size, power and particularly cost, to less than $3 for an IMU. There is great interest in understanding future trends for MEMS and their potential threat to traditional sensors for tactical and navigation grade applications. One author has many years of experience in developing macro-scale high-performance sensors and IMUs. The other author has many years of experience in supplying design tools to leading MEMS organizations worldwide. We will first describe trends that are affecting MEMS inertial sensors, including commoditization, consolidation of advanced CMOS manufacturing, market demands for increasing package-and chip-scale integration, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the entry of mainstream CMOS foundries to MEMS manufacturing. We'll speculate on the direction that could lead to greatest business success for foundries and their customers. We will then survey promising approaches to improving the performance of MEMS sensors and we will conclude with speculations on the roadmap and timeline for a possible crossover for MEMS in high-performance applications.},

abstract = {Range sensors for assisted backup and parking have potential for saving human lives and for facilitating parking in challenging situations. However, important features such as curbs and ramps are difficult to detect using ultrasonic or microwave sensors. TOF imaging range sensors may be used successfully for this purpose. In this paper we present a study concerning the use of the Canesta TOF camera for recognition of curbs and ramps. Our approach is based on the detection of individual planar patches using CC-RANSAC, a modified version of the classic RANSAC robust regression algorithm. Whereas RANSAC uses the whole set of inliers to evaluate the fitness of a candidate plane, CC-RANSAC only considers the largest connected components of inliers. We provide experimental evidence that CC-RANSAC provides a more accurate estimation of the dominant plane than RANSAC with a smaller number of iterations. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

The goal is to estimate simultaneously, the vehicle dynamics, the road bank angle and road friction coefficient in the presence of disturbance input. The observer gain is obtained as a solution of a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) problem. Finally, an estimation procedure of the road slope angle in the presence of the pitching moment disturbance due to the load transfer during the acceleration or braking phase is proposed.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The procedure of determining the initial values of the attitude angles (pitch, roll, and heading) is known as the alignment. Also, it is essential to align an inertial system before the start of navigation. Unless the inertial system is not aligned with the vehicle, the information provided by MEMS (microelectromechanical system) sensors is not useful for navigating the vehicle. At the moment MEMS gyroscopes have poor characteristics and it's necessary to develop specific algorithms in order to obtain the attitude information of the object. Most of the standard algorithms for the attitude estimation are not suitable when using MEMS inertial sensors. The wavelet technique, the Kalman filter, and the quaternion are not new in navigation data processing. But the joint use of those techniques for MEMS sensor data processing can give some new results. In this paper the performance of a developed algorithm for the attitude estimation using MEMS IMU (inertial measurement unit) is tested. The obtained results are compared with the attitude output of another commercial GPS/IMU device by Xsens. The impact of MEMS sensor measurement noises on an alignment process is analysed. Some recommendations for the Kalman filter algorithm tuning to decrease standard deviation of the attitude estimation are given. {\textcopyright} 2012 Vadim Bistrov.},

abstract = {The research on assisting visually impaired people to navigate in unknown environments commonly employs image processing or computer vision techniques. One key element that needs to be identified in the surrounding environment of a blind user is the ground plane. Its accurate detection is highly important because the user is able to move freely in that area. An assistive device should primarily assist the user in avoiding the obstacles that lie on the ground surface. The images that will be further processed are usually acquired using depth acquisition devices worn by the user. Therefore, in contrast with automotive or robotics applications, which also heavily rely on ground plane extraction for obstacle detection, the camera orientation has more degrees of freedom. This leads to the requirement of designing more complex solutions for the ground plane detection in the case of assistive systems for the visually impaired. In this paper we introduce an algorithm to detect the ground plane taking into consideration the orientation of the camera, namely its pitch and roll. The proposed algorithm is based on an efficient processing of the v-disparity map associated to each frame. A two-step decision making approach to determine the most suited area that corresponds to the ground plane is described. Experimental results with synthetic datasets are provided to prove the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new technique for plane detection from 3D point clouds is proposed. The algorithm depends on two concepts to balance between high-accuracy and fast performance. The first is the use of a new fast octree-based balanced density down-sampling technique to reduce the number of points. The second is the fact that the number of planes in any dataset is much less than the number of the points. Random points are examined to find the 3D planes. To increase the accuracy, the system utilizes an adaptive plane extraction technique to overcome data noise. Initially, the point cloud is subdivided using octree into small cubes with a limited number of points. Then the cubes are down-sampled based on the local density of each cube. The points are explored randomly for finding a planar surface by applying principal component analysis (PCA) on the points' spherical neighborhood obtained by the down-sampled octree structure. The adaptive plane extraction is used to adjust the plane orientation to find the best position that includes the maximum number of points. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of processing large amounts of data efficiently to produce accurate results that are robust to noise.},

This article presents a review of state-of-the-art automotive lidar technologies and the perception algorithms used with those technologies. Lidar systems are introduced first by analyzing such a system?s main components, from laser transmitter to beamscanning mechanism. The advantages/disadvantages and the current status of various solutions are introduced and compared. Then, the specific perception pipeline for lidar data processing is detailed from an autonomous vehicle perspective. The model-driven approaches and emerging deep learning (DL) solutions are reviewed. Finally, we provide an overview of the limitations, challenges, and trends for automotive lidars and perception systems.},

abstract = {Real-world vehicle fuel use and emission rates depend on engine load, which is quantified in terms of Vehicle Specific Power (VSP). VSP depends on vehicle speed, acceleration, and road grade. There is not a standard method for measuring road grade from a moving vehicle. A method for quantifying grade is evaluated based on statistical analysis of multiple runs using low cost consumer grade Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers with in-built Barometric Altimeter (GPS/BA). The average grade precision is ±0.71, ±0.46, and ±0.31 percentage points, for sample sizes of 9, 18, and 36GPS/BA runs, respectively, among 2213 individual 0.08km road segments. In addition, 4 sets of repeated measurements were performed on the same routes using a high cost, high accuracy Differential GPS (DGPS). Both sets of GPS-based grade estimates compared well with those derived from LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data. GPS/BA and DGPS grade estimates were similar, except for high magnitude grades of 8-10 percent for which DGPS estimates are more accurate. DGPS is more sensitive to loss of signal; thus, a hybrid approach for substituting GPS/BA data for missing DGPS data at specific locations along a route is demonstrated. The local and overall effects of road grade on fuel use and emission rates are investigated for an example light duty gasoline vehicle. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

This review presents an extensive overview of Microelectronechanical Systems (MEMS) scanning mirrors specifically for applications in LiDAR systems. MEMS mirror-based laser scanners have unrivalled advantages in terms of size, speed and cost over other types of laser scanners, making them ideal for LiDAR in a wide range of applications. A figure of merit (FoM) is defined for MEMS mirrors in LiDAR scanners in terms of aperture size, field of view (FoV) and resonant frequency. Various MEMS mirrors based on different actuation mechanisms are compared using the FoM. Finally, a preliminary assessment of off-the-shelf MEMS scanned LiDAR systems is given.},

Distributed data fusion is utilized to ensure that the storage requirement of known roads does not increase when additional measurements are processed.
