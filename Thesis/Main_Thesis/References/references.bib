abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Inertial sensors based on MEMS technology are fast becoming ubiquitous with their adoption into many types of consumer electronics products, including smart phones, tablets, gaming systems, TV remotes, toys, and even (more recently) power tools and wearable sensors. Now a standard feature of most smart phones, MEMS-based motion tracking enhances the user interface by allowing response to user motions, complements the GPS receiver by providing dead-reckoning indoor navigation and supporting location-based services, and holds the promise of enabling handset optical image stabilization in next-generation handsets by virtue of its lower cost and small form factor. This tutorial provides an overview of MEMS technology and describes the essential features of the mechanical systems underlying the most common sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes. It also highlights some fundamental trade-offs related to mechanical system dynamics, force and charge transduction methods, and their implications for the mixed-signal systems that process the sensor outputs. The presentation of an energy-based metric allows a comparison of the performance of competing sensor solutions. For each type of sensor, descriptions of the underlying mechanical theory, canonical sensor architectures, and key design challenges are also presented. Finally, the tutorial reviews multisensor silicon MEMS/CMOS monolithic integration, which is driving the cost and form factor reduction behind the current proliferation of these devices. {\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The market for high-performance inertial sensors, tactical grade and above, has been dominated to date by macro-scale devices such as HRGs, RLGs and FOGs. While the size, power requirements, and cost of these sensors have decreased considerably over the past two decades and further reductions can be expected, the tactical IMU size remains on the order of 0.5l, and the cost remains in the $10k range. During the same period, micro-scale inertial sensors based on MEMS technology have been introduced for automotive and consumer electronics applications and are now produced at the rate of several million per day. MEMS IMUs have become truly ubiquitous, however they have so far fallen short of the requirements for high-performance applications. Nevertheless, there have been continuing reductions in their size, power and particularly cost, to less than $3 for an IMU. There is great interest in understanding future trends for MEMS and their potential threat to traditional sensors for tactical and navigation grade applications. One author has many years of experience in developing macro-scale high-performance sensors and IMUs. The other author has many years of experience in supplying design tools to leading MEMS organizations worldwide. We will first describe trends that are affecting MEMS inertial sensors, including commoditization, consolidation of advanced CMOS manufacturing, market demands for increasing package-and chip-scale integration, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the entry of mainstream CMOS foundries to MEMS manufacturing. We'll speculate on the direction that could lead to greatest business success for foundries and their customers. We will then survey promising approaches to improving the performance of MEMS sensors and we will conclude with speculations on the roadmap and timeline for a possible crossover for MEMS in high-performance applications.},

abstract = {The information of the road grade is an important input for advanced driver assistance systems to improve the vehicle ride comfort, safety, and fuel consumption. Current approaches for road grade estimation in the literature have various disadvantages, e.g., they lack in resolution and sample rate or use data from a lot of sensors, often not from series production. This paper presents methods, which are based on filters that combine the measurements from an inexpensive gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer to estimate the orientation of the sensor relative to the earth's surface. The methods are evaluated using high-resolution road grade data as reference, which were acquired with an aircraft and the light detection and ranging technique. The road grade information, calculated in the vehicle in real-time, could be transmitted to a central database and merged with information of other vehicles. Therefore, digital maps for advanced driver assistance systems could be kept updated in very short intervals with high-resolution road grade information.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles rely on their perception systems to acquire information about their immediate surroundings. It is necessary to detect the presence of other vehicles, pedestrians, and other relevant entities. Safety concerns and the need for accurate estimations have led to the introduction of lidar systems to complement camera-or radar-based perception systems. This article presents a review of state-of-the-art automotive lidar technologies and the perception algorithms used with those technologies. Lidar systems are introduced first by analyzing such a system?s main components, from laser transmitter to beamscanning mechanism. The advantages/disadvantages and the current status of various solutions are introduced and compared. Then, the specific perception pipeline for lidar data processing is detailed from an autonomous vehicle perspective. The model-driven approaches and emerging deep learning (DL) solutions are reviewed. Finally, we provide an overview of the limitations, challenges, and trends for automotive lidars and perception systems.},

LiDAR is believed to be the crucial sensor for autonomous driving and flying, as it can provide high-density point clouds with accurate three-dimensional information. This review presents an extensive overview of Microelectronechanical Systems (MEMS) scanning mirrors specifically for applications in LiDAR systems. MEMS mirror-based laser scanners have unrivalled advantages in terms of size, speed and cost over other types of laser scanners, making them ideal for LiDAR in a wide range of applications. A figure of merit (FoM) is defined for MEMS mirrors in LiDAR scanners in terms of aperture size, field of view (FoV) and resonant frequency. Various MEMS mirrors based on different actuation mechanisms are compared using the FoM. Finally, a preliminary assessment of off-the-shelf MEMS scanned LiDAR systems is given.},

abstract = {Multi-level road junctions are becoming increasingly popular in several major cities. In order to cope with such scenarios, car navigation systems require positioning units to supply accurate slope information. This knowledge allows correct matching to one of the options available from 3D maps. For cost reasons, slope needs to be obtained using consumer-grade MEMS IMUs. One method to assess the vehicle pitch angle, is using accelerometer, although the contributions of gravity and motion need to be separated from its output. This compensation procedure, in land vehicle applications, is possible when unit is connected to vehicle (e.g. via CAN bus); in such a way motion information can be obtained and removed from the raw accelerometer measurements. These measurements, even when calibrated and motion-compensated, are affected by issues such as noise (vibrations, quantization and differentiation), biases due to lever arm between wheels and sensor, IMU cross axis effects, etc. These issues prevent accelerometer-only slope estimation to reach acceptable performance in multilevel navigation scenarios. In order to overcome them, this research work proposes to use gyroscope observables to complement the accelerometer in the pitch estimation algorithm. The gyroscope provides relative angle measurements, with the advantage of being very accurate on high frequencies, while drifting with time due to integration of biases. The accelerometer, instead, is typically subject to large errors at high frequencies. The two sensors observables have been merged into an innovative sensor fusion algorithm, based on two cascaded Kalman filters, in addition to the GNSS receiver data. The first one exploits GNSS PVT Outputs (e.g. altitude and vertical velocity) and car travelled path information, in order to calibrate and motion-compensate the accelerometer output. It provides also a smoothed, GNSS independent altitude estimation. The second one takes as input the raw slopes output from the first stage and performs fusion with the gyroscope signals. This stage also estimates the gyroscope calibration parameters. Algorithms have been designed and modelled in MATLAB™, validated on real field data acquired through a sensor logging equipment featuring a commercial GNSS receiver, a consumer-grade 6 axis IMU and a pressure sensor. The barometer measurements are not yet used in the sensor fusion algorithm, instead are fed to an alternative post processing method (also described in this work) providing a robust reference for validation. Simulation results confirms that the estimated slope is sufficiently smooth and accurate for multilevel junction navigation. This new algorithm overcomes the limitations of accelerometer-only architectures and constitutes an important building block for performance improvements of attitude and heading reference systems in automotive contexts. It could also be the basis for the development of a fully inertial navigation system. Future developments include the integration of the barometric information in the real time sensor fusion algorithm and extension to the other attitude angles.},
