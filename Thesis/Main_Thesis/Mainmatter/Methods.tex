\section{\glsentrytext{imu} only}
\subsection{Calibration}
Because the measurements of the \acrshort{imu} are measured in the device frame $\mathcal{I}$, which is not aligned with the car frame $\mathcal{C}$, they have to be transformed.
This can be achieved using a rotation matrix \mtf{i}{c} $\in \mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ which transforms the measurements of the linear acceleration $\vincs{a}{I}_n \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}$ and angular velocity ${\vincs{v}{I}_n \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}}$ into the car frame.
Note that the upper index? to the left of the matrix symbol denotes the source frame, whereas the destination frame is written below it.
 $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is the time step.\\
During standstill, the only measurable acceleration besides noise and bias is the acceleration due to gravity.
Assuming the car stands on flat ground, the gravity acceleration in the car frame is measured in upwards z-direction.
In a first step, the measured linear acceleration (gravity) in the \acrshort{imu} frame will be aligned with the z-axis of the car.
According to Euler's rotation theorem, which says that any arbitrary rotation of a rigid body while holding one point (origin) fixed can be achieved by a rotation around a single fixed axis passing through the origin, there exists one rotation axis $\mathbf{j}$ and rotation angle $\alpha$ to achieve this.\\
In the first step, the quaternion \qtf{i}{b} which describes the rotation from the device frame $\mathcal{I}$ to an intermediate coordinate system $\mathcal{B}$, which has the z-axis up, will be found.
Resulting in $\vincs{z}{b} = \vincs{z}{c} = \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{z} = \left(\begin{array}{lll} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right)^{\top}$.
Note that this is not necessarily true for the other axes, $\vincs{x}{b}\neq\vincs{x}{c}$ and $\vincs{z}{b}\neq\vincs{z}{c}$.\\
Using linear algebra \todo{better explaination} the rotation axis $\vb{j} \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}$, which is perpendicular to both \vincs{a}{i} and \vincs{z}{c}, can be found with
\begin{equation}
    \vb{j} = \frac{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \vdot \vincs{a}{c}}{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \cp \vincs{a}{c}}}
    = \frac{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \vdot \vb{e}_\mathrm{z} }{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \cp \vb{e}_\mathrm{z}}}
    = \frac{\vincs{\vu{a}_\mathrm{z}}{i}}{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}_\mathrm{y}}{i}\vb{e}_\mathrm{x} - \vincs{\vu{a}_\mathrm{x}}{i}\vb{e}_\mathrm{y}}}
\end{equation}
with $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}$ being the measured linear acceleration (average) in the \acrshort{imu} or car frame respectively and $\vu{a}$ being the unit vector of it.\\
The rotation angle can be calculated using
\begin{equation}
    \tan(\alpha) = \frac{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \cp \vb{e}_\mathrm{z}}}{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \vdot \vb{e}_\mathrm{z}} \implies
    \alpha = \arctan(\frac{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \cp \vb{e}_\mathrm{z}}}{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \vdot \vb{e}_\mathrm{z}})
\end{equation}
which results in combination with the rotation axis to the quaternion
\begin{equation}
    \qtf{i}{b} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \vb{j}\vdot\sin(\frac{\alpha}{2}) \\
        \cos(\frac{\alpha}{2})
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\itodo{Decide for a notation (w,x,y,z is more common I think)}
Now that the z-axes of both frames are aligned, the x- and y-axis can be aligned by a rotation around the z-axis.
To find this rotation angle $\beta$, the car has to be accelerated forward.
This acceleration is being measured along the x- and y-axis.
The z-axis is set to zero, because it only measures the gravity which is not of interest.
The resulting vector is being aligned with the forward axis of the car $\vincs{x}{c} = \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{x} = \left(\begin{array}{lll} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)^{\top}$, in the same way as before.
Resulting in the rotation angle
\begin{equation}
    \beta = \arctan(\frac{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}}{b} \cp \vb{e}_\mathrm{x}}}{\vincs{\vu{a}}{b} \vdot \vb{e}_\mathrm{x}})
\end{equation}
The resulting quaternion
\begin{equation}
    \qtf{b}{c} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \vb{e}_\mathrm{z}\vdot\sin(\frac{\beta}{2}) \\
        \cos(\frac{\beta}{2})
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
can then be concatenated with the previous quaternion to get the final quaternion
\begin{equation}
    \qtf{i}{c} = \qtf{b}{c} \otimes  \qtf{i}{b}
\end{equation}
A quaternion of the form
$\mathbf{q} = \left[\begin{array}{llll} w & x & y & z \end{array}\right]^{\top}$
can be converted to a rotation matrix with
\begin{equation}
    % { }_{\mathcal{C}}^{\mathcal{I}} \mathbf{M} =
    \mathbf{M} =
    \left[
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            1-2 y^{2}-2 z^{2} & 2(x y-z w) & 2(x z+y w) \\
            2(x y+z w) & 1-2 x^{2}-2 z^{2} & 2(y z-x w) \\
            2(x z-y w) & 2(y z+x w) & 1-2 x^{2}-2 y^{2}
        \end{array}
        \right]
    \end{equation}
And finally the measurements $\mathbf{A}$ can be transformed using
\begin{equation}
    \vincs{A}{c} = \mtf{i}{c} \vdot \vincs{A}{i}
\end{equation}

\section{\glsentrytext{lidar} only}
\subsection{Calibration}
\itodo{Describe \acrshort{lidar} calibration algorithm}
Same as for the \acrshort{imu}, a transformation from the \acrshort{lidar} frame to the car frame is necessary.
The calibration is very similar to that of the \acrshort{imu}.
At first both z-axes will be aligned.
This is achieved by detecting the ground plane in the point cloud and finding the transform, such that the normal vector of the plane aligns with the z-axis of the car (the plane gets projected onto the xy-plane of the car frame).
This results in the correct pitch and roll angle and the missing yaw angle is assumed to be zero.
Should it not be zero it can also be measured by hand and given as parameter.\\
For the ground plane detection \acrfull{ransac} \cite{Fischler1981} is used.
\acrshort{ransac} is a non-deterministic algorithm to remove outliers and is often used in computer vision.
\acrshort{ransac} can also be used for plane segmentation in 3D point clouds.
Consider a point cloud with $n$ points, where each point has a $x, y, z$ coordinate.
In a first step, three random points from the point cloud are selected.
Three, because this is the minimum number of points needed to get a plane.
Now the parameters $a, b, c, d$ of the plane equation
\begin{equation}
    ax + by + cz + d = 0
\end{equation}
can be calculated.
Then the deviation of the other points from the proposed plane can be calculated with
\begin{equation}
    dist = \frac{ax_i + by_i + cz_i + d}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}
\end{equation}
with i being \todo{pc set without 3 random points}.
If the distance is within the threshold, the point counts as inlier.
After iterating through the whole point cloud, the number of inlier points and their coordinates are stored.
This process is then repeated again until the maximal number of iterations are reached.
The plane with the greatest number of inliers is then selected.

A flow chart of the described algorithm is shown in figure \ref{fig:flowchart_lidar_calibration}.
\itodo{Not sure if flow chart is best way to help understand explaination. Algorithm pseudo code might be better}

    \label{fig:flowchart_lidar_calibration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{algo}
Because the raw \acrshort{lidar} data is too big to allow for real time processing, preprocessing is necessary.
It consists of a passthrough filter to remove unwanted points (e.g. behind the car) and a voxel grid filter to downsample the point cloud.
Before the passthrough filter can be applied, the point cloud must be transformed to the car frame.
The in the previous section described calibration algorithm is performed once at the start and its returned rotation is then applied to every new measurement.\\
The passthrough filter then removes all the points which lie outside the specified x, y and z limits.
Because the car drives forward, only points in front of the car are of interest.
Furthermore the points further away than a certain threshold are neglected, because the resolution of the measurements of the \acrshort{lidar} decrease with increasing distance.
The ceiling points are removed by limiting in z-direction.
The exact values used for the passthrough filter can be seen along the other parameters in table \ref{tab:lidar_params}.
The next step in reducing the point cloud size is the voxel grid filter \cite{Vosselman2004}.
The point cloud is converted into a 3D grid consisting of small cubes called voxels.
Each cube can contain multiple points, the size of the voxels (also known as leaf size) determines the resolution.
All the points inside a cube are then reduced to their most centroid point.
If the cube does not contain any points, it is neglected.\\
Now that the point cloud size is reduced greatly the actual ramp detection can be performed with sufficient performance.
The \acrshort{ransac} algorithm is applied iteratively to detect all the planes.
The \acrshort{ransac} algorithm returns the
An visual representation of the algorithm is depicted in fig. \ref{fig:flowchart_lidar}.

\subsection{\glsentrytext{imu} and Odometer}

\subsubsection{Car acceleration from odometer data}
Because the odometer only delivers the speed of each wheel, the car velocity has to be calculated first.
During turns the left and right wheels travel at different speeds, the wheel on the inner side of the turn travels slower, than the outer wheel.
E.g. during a left turn, the left wheel moves slower than the right wheel.
A simple yet sufficiently accurate model to calculate the car velocity from the wheel speeds is the linear single track model ("Einspurmodell") \cite{Mitschke2014}.
In this model both wheels on one axis are replaced with one wheel in the middle.
\itodo{Explain model}
The linear assumption holds true for low lateral accelerations (up to \SI{4}{\metre\per\second}), which will not be surpassed in the parking garage scenario.
Using the assumptions from above, the car velocity $v_\mathrm{car}(t)$ can be calculated with
\begin{align}
    \alpha(t) &= \frac{v_\mathrm{rl}(t) - v_\mathrm{rr}(t)}{d} \\
    \gamma(t) &= \frac{\alpha(t)}{f_\mathrm{odom}} \\
    v_\mathrm{car}(t) &= \frac{v_\mathrm{rl}(t) + v_\mathrm{rr}(t)}{2}\cdot\cos(\gamma)
\end{align}
with $v_\mathrm{rl} \text{ and } v_\mathrm{rr}$ being the wheel speeds of the rear right and rear left wheel respectively.
$\alpha$ is a helper variable \todo{I can't explain it well}, $d$ the track width! and $\gamma$ is the yaw angle of the car.\\
The car's acceleration can be derived from the velocity using
\begin{equation}
    a_\mathrm{car}(t) = \dv{t}v_\mathrm{car}.
\end{equation}
But because all measurements are discrete, numerical differentiation e.g. forward difference must be used
\begin{equation}
    a_\mathrm{car}(h) = \frac{v_\mathrm{car}(x + h) - v_\mathrm{car}(x)}{h}
\end{equation}
with $h$ being the step size, which depends on the rate of the sensor.
