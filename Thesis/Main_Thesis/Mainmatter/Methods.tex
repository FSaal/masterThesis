The road grade $\alpha$ is the angle between the road plane and the ground plane.
The ground plane is perpendicular to the gravity vector.
The road grade can be represented as an angle
\begin{equation}
	\alpha = \arctan(\frac{h}{d})
\end{equation}
or in percentage
\begin{equation}
	r = 100\cdot\tan(\alpha).
\end{equation}
The pitch angle $\theta$ of the car is defined as the angle between the ground plane and the longitudinal axis of the car.
If the car accelerates or decelerates the suspension does get compressed in the back or respectively front, which makes the pitch angle not in alignment with the road grade anymore.
The difference between the two angles is defined as $\beta = \theta - \alpha$ and may also occur due to rotational movement or vibrations.
The mentioned variables are visualized in \cref{fig:tikz_car_tilt}.\\
In this chapter different sensors and methods will be tested to estimate the car's pitch angle.
A common problem is that the coordinate frame of the sensor is usually not aligned with car's frame, see \cref{fig:tikz_car_frames}.
To determine the true car pitch angle the sensor frame must be transformed onto the car frame.
Semi-automatic calibration methods for the \gls{imu} and \gls{lidar} sensor will be represented, which determine the necessary rotation to align both frames.
But the translation difference can not be easily estimated and must be measured by hand.\\
At first the accelerometer and gyroscope of the \gls{imu} will be used separately to determine the pitch angle.
Then it will be tested how the estimate improves when both sensors will be used together in a complementary filter.
The gravity method, which involves the accelerometer and wheel sensor measurements will be tested as well.
A method using a \gls{lidar} sensor will be represented in the end, followed by a final method which incorporates all available sensors.

\section{\glsentrytext{imu} only}
\subsection{Calibration}
The \gls{imu} is usually not placed in such a way, that the coordinate frame of the device $\mathcal{I}$ aligns with that of the car $\mathcal{C}$, see \cref{fig:tikz_frame_transformation_init}.
Because of that, a transformation between the two frames must be found.
This can be achieved using a rotation matrix \mtf{i}{c} $\in \mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ which transforms the measurements of the linear acceleration $\vincs{a}{I}_n \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}$ and angular velocity ${\vincs{v}{I}_n \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}}$ into the car frame.
Note that the upper index to the left of the matrix symbol denotes the source frame, whereas the destination frame is written below it.
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ is the time step.\\
During standstill, the only measurable acceleration besides noise and bias is the acceleration due to gravity.
Assuming the car stands on flat ground, the gravity acceleration in the car frame is measured only in upwards z-direction.
Using this, a transformation from \gls{imu} frame $\mathcal{I}$ to the intermediate frame $\mathcal{B}$ can be found.
In the new $\mathcal{B}$ frame both z-axes are aligned $\vincs{z}{b} = \vincs{z}{c}$ and thus the pitch and roll angle between the two frames become zero.
Note that this is not necessarily true for the other axes, $\vincs{x}{b}\neq\vincs{x}{c}$ and $\vincs{y}{b}\neq\vincs{y}{c}$, see \cref{fig:tikz_frame_transformation_intermediate}.\\
According to Euler's rotation theorem, which says that any arbitrary rotation of a rigid body while holding one point (origin) fixed can be achieved by a rotation around a single fixed axis passing through the origin, there exists one rotation axis $\mathbf{j}$ and rotation angle $\alpha$ to achieve this.\\
As described in \cref{subsec:vector_projection}, the rotation axis needed for the transformation can be calculated by
\begin{equation}
	\vb{j} = \frac{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \cp \vincs{\vu{z}}{c}}{\norm{\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \cp \vincs{\vu{z}}{c}}}
\end{equation}
and the rotation angle with
\begin{equation}
	\alpha = \arccos(\vincs{\vu{a}}{i}\vdot \vincs{\vu{z}}{c})
\end{equation}
with $\vincs{\vu{a}}{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times3}$ being the normalized measured linear acceleration in the \gls{imu} frame and \vincs{\vu{z}}{c} the (normalized) z-axis of the car.\\
The quaternion
\begin{equation}
	\qtf{i}{b} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\vb{j}\vdot\sin(\frac{\alpha}{2}) \\
		\cos(\frac{\alpha}{2})
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
then describes the rotation between the two frames.\\
Now that the z-axes of the $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ frame are aligned, the x- and y-axis can be aligned by a rotation $\beta$ around the z-axis.
This yaw correction could usually be achieved using the magnetometer measurements, but because those are heavily obscured indoors and especially in the parking garage \cite{Li2012}, another solution must be found.
A possible solution to this problem is accelerating the car straightforward and then using the accelerometer to measure along which axis the acceleration occurred.
Assuming the car tilt (pitch) during the acceleration is minimal, the acceleration is only being measured along the x- and y-axis.
The resulting vector is being aligned with the forward axis of the car, such that $\vincs{\hat{a}}{b} = \vincs{x}{c}$, in the same way as before.
Resulting in the rotation angle
\begin{equation}
	\beta = \arccos(\vincs{\vu{a}}{b} \vdot \vincs{\hat{x}}{c})
\end{equation}
and the quaternion
\begin{equation}
	\qtf{b}{c} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\vincs{\hat{z}}{c}\vdot\sin(\frac{\beta}{2}) \\
		\cos(\frac{\beta}{2})
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The two quaternions can then be concatenated (in reverse order) to get the final quaternion
\begin{equation}
	\qtf{i}{c} = \qtf{b}{c} \otimes  \qtf{i}{b}
\end{equation}
which transforms the measurements of the \gls{imu} to the car frame.\\
The quaternion is then converted into a rotation matrix, because it is faster.
\iimprov{What exactly is faster?}
\iquest{Is this true? Was true when I tested it myself, but would've thought quat is faster}
Finally the measurements $\mathbf{A}$ can be transformed using
\begin{equation}
	\vincs{A}{c} = \mtf{i}{c} \vdot \vincs{A}{i}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Linear acceleration only}
\label{ssec:linear_acceleration_only}
If the car stands still, the only measurable acceleration besides measurement errors is the acceleration due to gravity.
When standing on flat ground, only the z-axis measures an acceleration.
But when the car is tilted, e.g. on a ramp, the gravity is measured also by the x-axis (which points forward), see \cref{fig:tikz_car_gravity}.
The proportion of the acceleration measured along the x-axis $\vb{a}_\mathrm{x} $ of the overall gravity $\vb{g}$ can then be used to determine the pitch angle in the following way
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ang_from_acc}
	\theta_\mathrm{acc}  = \arcsin(\frac{\vb{a}_x}{\norm{\vb{g}}})
\end{equation}
with $\norm{\vb{g}}$ being the magnitude of the overall measured acceleration.
According to the definition, the angle is zero if the car is parallel to the ground and \SI{90}{\degree} if the front of the car would be pointing straight up.
The angle is positive when driving up a ramp and negative if driving down.\\
Disadvantages of this method are that the acceleration measurements are quite noisy and that no other accelerations are taken into account, e.g. the on track acceleration $\vb{a}_\mathrm{at}$ caused by the motor.
This is a problem when the car has a non-zero acceleration, because the acceleration along the x-axis is given by
\begin{equation}
	\vb{a}_\mathrm{x} = \vb{a}_\mathrm{at} + \vb{g}_\mathrm{x}
\end{equation}
and $\vb{a}_\mathrm{x} = \vb{g}_\mathrm{x} $ only holds true, when the car is driving with constant velocity or standing still.
A better approach, which incorporates the accelerations caused by the car, is described in \cref{subsubsec:gravity_method}.

	\input{Graphics/TikZ/car_gravity.tex}
	\caption{Gravity measured by \acrshort{imu} (in car frame).}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Angular velocity only}
\iimprov{Find good source and use it as a guide}
\cite{Kok2017}
The gyroscope measures the angular velocity, which must be integrated with respect to time, to get the rotation angle.
The angular velocity is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ being the sample time.
The current angle $\theta(t)$ can be computed with the integral
\begin{equation}
	\theta(t) = \theta_0 + \int_0^t \omega(\tau)\dd{\tau}
\end{equation}
with $\theta_0$ being the initial angle.
\\\\
The period between two samples $kT$
\\\\
However, due to the finite amount of samples, numerical integration must be used.
Different techniques exist, using the backward Euler method the
\begin{equation}
	\theta_t = \frac{\theta_t - \theta_{t - 1}}{T}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\theta(k) = \frac{\theta(k) - \theta(k - 1)}{T}
\end{equation}
The current angle can then be estimated by calculating the cumulative sum of all measurements
\begin{equation}
	\theta_k = \theta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^k \theta_i
\end{equation}
with $\theta_0$ being the initial angle which must be known beforehand.
To get the pitch angle, only the measurements along the y-axis are of interest.\\
Disadvantages of using only the angular velocity are that the estimations are not reliable over a long period of time.
The random walk introduced by integrating white noise or a constant bias causes the estimation to drift away from the true value.
\iimprov{One time common derivation and then for specific case (y)}


\subsection{Complementary filter}
The complementary uses both the linear acceleration and angular velocity measurements and combines them using sensor fusion, such that the good properties of each sensor are used to reduce the poor properties of the other.
% As described in the previous subsections the pitch angle can be estimated using the accelerometer data with
% \begin{equation}
% 	\theta_\mathrm{acc}  = \arcsin(\frac{\vb{a}_x}{\norm{\vb{g}}})
% \end{equation}
% The gyroscope data must be integrated to get the angle
% \begin{equation}
% 	\theta_\mathrm{gyr}(t) = \theta_\mathrm{gyr,0} + \int_0^t \omega_\mathrm{gyr}  \dd{t}
% \end{equation}
% \iquest{Should I just reference the formulas, or should I write them here again?}
The angle estimation obtained from the linear acceleration is reliable in the long-term, but is quite noisy.
The estimation from the angular velocity measurements on the other hand provide good short-term accuracy, but should not be used for longer estimations due to drift.
These properties can be interpreted in the frequency domain.
The error from the accelerometer data is subject to high frequency noise, whereas the estimation error from the gyroscope is mostly due to low frequency noise \cite{2007Colton}.
To minimize the error of the linear acceleration estimate, a \gls{lpf} should be used.
A \gls{lpf} passes all signals with frequency lower than a certain cut-off frequency $f_0$ and attenuates signals with a frequency above $f_0$.
In contrast, a \gls{hpf} should be used on the estimate of the gyroscope.
A \gls{hpf} works exactly opposite to a \gls{lpf}.
It blocks signals with a frequency below $f_0$ while allowing signals over this frequency to pass through \cite{Lyons1996}. A block diagram of the complementary filter is shown in \cref{fig:tikz_complementary_filter}.\\
The angle estimation obtained from the linear acceleration (\cref{eq:ang_from_acc}) will be referred to as $\theta_\mathrm{acc}$, the angle estimation from the gyroscope estimation as $\theta_\mathrm{gyr}$ and the fused estimation of the complementary filter will be denoted as $\hat{\theta}$.
As seen in REF, $\theta_\mathrm{gyr}$ is calculated by integrating the angular velocity $\omega_\mathrm{gyr} $ measured by the gyroscope.
The Laplace transformation can be used to transform the angles from the time domain to the frequency domain.
The angles $\theta_\mathrm{acc}$, $\theta_\mathrm{gyr}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ will be denoted as $\Theta_\mathrm{acc}(s)$, $\Theta_\mathrm{gyr}(s)$ and $\hat{\Theta}(s)$ in the frequency domain, the gyroscope measurements $\omega_\mathrm{gyr} $ as $\Omega_\mathrm{gyr} (s)$.
The complimentary filter estimate is computed by
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:compl_filter_laplace}
	\hat{\Theta}(s) & = G_\mathrm{low}(s)\Theta_\mathrm{acc}(s) + (1 - G_\mathrm{low}(s))\Theta_\mathrm{gyr}(s) \nonumber   \\
	                & = G_\mathrm{low}(s)\Theta_\mathrm{acc}(s) + (1 - G_\mathrm{low}(s))\frac{1}{s}\Omega_\mathrm{gyr} (s)
\end{align}
where $G_\mathrm{low}(s)$ is the transfer function of a \gls{lpf} and $1-G_\mathrm{low}(s) = G_\mathrm{high}(s)$ the of a \gls{hpf} \cite{Kok2017}.
The sum of $G_\mathrm{low}(s)$ and $1-G_\mathrm{low}(s)$ is equal to one, which means that the cut-off frequency of both filters must be the same.
The transfer functions are defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:lpf}
	G_\mathrm{low} (s) = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha s}
\end{equation}
for the \gls{lpf} and
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:hpf}
	G_\mathrm{high} (s) = \frac{\alpha s}{1 + \alpha s}
\end{equation}
for the \gls{hpf}, when using a first-order filter.
$\alpha$ is the filter coefficient and has the following influence on the cut-off frequency
\begin{equation}
	\alpha
	= \frac{\tau}{\tau + T}
	% = \frac{1}{w_0}
	= \frac{1}{2\pi f_0}.
	\label{eq:filter_f0}
\end{equation}
with $\tau$ being the time constant of the filter and $T$ being the sample period.
Inserting \cref{eq:lpf} and \cref{eq:hpf} in \cref{eq:compl_filter_laplace} and using inverse Laplace transformation as well as Euler backward discretization, the complementary filter can be written in discrete time as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\theta}_t = \gamma\left(\hat{\theta}_{t - 1} + T \omega_{\mathrm{gyr},t}\right) + (1 - \gamma) \theta_{\mathrm{acc},t},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:filter_gain}
	\gamma = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + T} \in [0,1]
\end{equation}
being the filter gain.
The choice of the parameter $\alpha$ (and hence $\gamma$) determines, how much each of the two measurements should be trusted.
Selecting a small $\alpha$ ($\gamma$ close to zero) results in a high cut-off frequency.
The estimation then mostly uses the accelerometer data.
Contrary, a high value of $\alpha$ leads to a $\gamma$ close to one and low cut-off frequency, where the gyroscope estimation is trusted more \cite{1997Baerveldt}.\\
% A decrease of $\alpha$ leads to a smoother signal, but at the cost of adding some additional time delay.
Selecting the right filter coefficient is a known problem and is usually solved by calculating an initial guess followed by fine-tuning by hand to get the desired result.
One option to get an initial guess is by measuring the drift of the gyroscope and selecting the filter coefficient accordingly.
The time $T_\mathrm{free}$ where the drift of the angle estimation from the gyroscope is negligible, is inversely proportional to the cut-off frequency $f_0 = \frac{1}{T_\mathrm{free}}$.
E.g. if the drift from the gyroscope is only negligible for \SI{10}{\second} then the cut-off frequency should be chosen at $f_0 = \frac{1}{\SI{10}{\second}} = \SI{0.1}{\hertz}$ or higher.
The filter gain can then be calculated using \cref{eq:filter_f0} and \cref{eq:filter_gain}.
Using the previous example and assuming a sample frequency of \SI{100}{\hertz}, the filter gain would then be $\gamma = 0.9938$.
For the experiment a cut-off frequency of $f_0=?$ was chosen, resulting in filter coefficient of $\alpha = ?$ and filter gain of $\gamma = ?$.

\section{\glsentrytext{lidar} only}
\itodo{Maybe brief overview of section/algorithm}
\itodo{Add pcl citation somewhere \cite{Rusu2011}}
\subsection{Calibration}
As for the \gls{imu}, a transformation from the \gls{lidar} frame to the car frame is necessary.
The calibration is very similar to that of the \gls{imu}.
At first both z-axes will be aligned.
This is achieved by detecting the ground plane in the point cloud and finding the transform, such that the normal vector of the plane aligns with the z-axis of the car (the plane gets projected onto the xy-plane of the car frame).
This results in the correct pitch and roll angle.
The yaw angle can not be determined and is assumed to be zero, but can also be measured by hand and given as parameter.\\
For the ground plane detection \gls{ransac} \cite{Fischler1981} is used.\\
\gls{ransac} is a non-deterministic algorithm to remove outliers and is often used in computer vision.
\gls{ransac} can also be used for plane segmentation in 3D point clouds.
Consider a point cloud with $n$ points, where point $i$ has the coordinates $x_i, y_i, z_i$.
In a first step, three random points from the point cloud are selected.
Three, because this is the minimum number of points needed for a plane.
Now the parameters $a, b, c, d$ of the plane equation
\begin{equation}
	ax + by + cz + d = 0
\end{equation}
can be calculated.
Then for every other point the deviation from the proposed plane can be calculated by
\begin{equation}
	r = \frac{ax_i + by_i + cz_i + d}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}
\end{equation}
and is then summed up.
If the distance is within a certain threshold, the point counts as an inlier.
After iterating through the whole point cloud, the number of inlier points and their coordinates are stored.
This process is then repeated until the maximal number of iterations are reached.
The plane with the greatest number of inliers is then selected.\\
Then the normal vector of the plane, which can be conducted from the plane equation as follows
\begin{equation}
	\vb{n} = \left(\begin{array}{lll} a & b & c \end{array}\right)^{\intercal}
\end{equation}
is projected onto the z-axis of the car.
The necessary rotation is then applied to the detected plane.
Now that a plane has been found it must be ensured, that it really is the ground plane.
Typically, either the ceiling, ground or a side wall gets detected with \gls{ransac}.
The greater the plane is (or the more points lie inside a plane), the more likely is the detection of the plane.
Due to the mounting and \gls{fov} of the \gls{lidar}, the ceiling usually does have the most points and is thus detected in the first iteration.\\
An accidental ceiling detection can be prevented by looking at the average z-values of the detected plane.
Because the \gls{lidar} is mounted on the roof of the car, the z-values of the detected plane must be negative.
If they are positive, the ceiling has been detected.
Furthermore it is known, that the WHICH angle to rotate the \gls{lidar} to level ground should not exceed the mount angle.
If that is the case, most likely a side wall has been detected.
If either condition has not been fulfilled, the detected plane does get removed from the point cloud and using \gls{ransac} a new ground plane estimation is made and validated.
This process gets repeated until both conditions are fulfilled.
The yaw angle and the x- and y-translation from the \gls{lidar} to the centered front of the car
must be entered manually, but the pitch and roll angle and the distance from the \gls{lidar} to the ground are used from the calibration.


\subsection{Algorithm}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\input{Graphics/TikZ/flowchart_lidar.tex}
	\caption{Algo for ramp detection}
	\label{fig:flowchart_lidar}
\end{figure}
Because the raw \gls{lidar} data is too big to allow for real time processing, preprocessing is necessary.
It consists of a passthrough filter to remove unwanted points (e.g. behind the car) and a voxel grid filter to downsample the point cloud.
Before the passthrough filter can be applied, the point cloud must be transformed to the car frame.
The in the previous section described calibration algorithm is performed once at the start and its returned rotation is then applied to every new measurement.\\
The passthrough filter then removes all the points which lie outside the specified x, y and z limits.
Because the car drives forward, only points in front of the car are of interest.
Furthermore, the points further away than a certain threshold are neglected, because the resolution and accuracy of the measurements of the \gls{lidar} decreases with increasing distance.
The ceiling points are removed by limiting the points in z-direction.
The exact values used for the passthrough filter can be seen along the other parameters in \cref{tab:lidar_params}.\\
The next step in reducing the point cloud size is the voxel grid filter \cite{Vosselman2004}.
The point cloud is converted into a 3D grid consisting of small cubes called voxels.
Each cube can contain multiple points or none, the size of the voxels (also known as leaf size) determines the resolution.
All the points inside a cube are then reduced to their most centroid point.
If the cube does not contain any points, it is neglected.\\
Now that the point cloud size is reduced greatly the actual ramp detection can be performed with sufficient performance.
The \gls{ransac} algorithm usually detects the following types of planes: ceiling, ground, side wall or the desired ramp.
\gls{ransac} is applied iteratively until a plane of type ramp has been found.
If a plane of different type has been found, it gets removed and the \gls{ransac} algorithm is applied again.
To prevent an infinite loop, the algorithm will exit after either a certain number of iterations has been performed, or if after the removal of a plane not enough points are left in the point cloud.\\
The accidental detection of the ceiling was already prevented during the passthrough filter step, where the ceiling points have been removed from the point cloud.
By limiting the maximal angle between the ground plane and the detected plane the side walls are ignored.
Similarly, the detected plane gets classified as ground plane, if the angle between the ground plane and the detected plane is near zero (or below the specified minimum angle).
Beside the angle, the width of the plane (y-range) is being calculated and compared to the parameters, to make sure that the plane is a drivable ramp for cars and not e.g. a small ramp for wheelchairs \todo{no idea if wheel chair ramps are common in parking garages?}.
The distance to the ramp is estimated by taking the $n$ nearest points of the ramp plane and calculating their mean.
If a ramp has been detected, the estimated angle and distance from the car front to the beginning of the ramp are returned.\\
A visual representation of the algorithm is depicted in \cref{fig:flowchart_lidar}.

\subsection{\glsentrytext{imu} and Odometer}

\subsubsection{Car acceleration from odometer data}
Because the odometer only delivers the speed of each wheel, the car velocity has to be calculated.
During turns the left and right wheels travel at different speeds, the wheel on the inner side of the turn travels slower, than the outer wheel.
E.g. during a left turn, the left wheel moves slower than the right wheel.
A simple yet sufficiently accurate model to calculate the car velocity from the wheel speeds is the linear single track model \cite{Mitschke2014}.
In this model both wheels on one axis are replaced with one wheel in the middle.
The linear assumption holds true for low lateral accelerations (up to \SI{4}{\metre\per\second}), which will not be surpassed in the parking garage scenario.
Using the assumptions from above, the car velocity $v_\mathrm{car}(t)$ can be calculated by
\begin{align}
	\alpha(t)         & = \frac{v_\mathrm{rl}(t) - v_\mathrm{rr}(t)}{d}                  \\
	\gamma(t)         & = \frac{\alpha(t)}{f_\mathrm{odom}}                              \\
	v_\mathrm{car}(t) & = \frac{v_\mathrm{rl}(t) + v_\mathrm{rr}(t)}{2}\cdot\cos(\gamma)
\end{align}
with $v_\mathrm{rl} \text{ and } v_\mathrm{rr}$ being the wheel speeds of the rear right and rear left wheel respectively, $d$ the track width and $\gamma$ is the yaw angle of the car, which can be calculated from the steering wheel angle.\\
The car's acceleration can be derived from the velocity using
\begin{equation}
	a_\mathrm{car}(t) = \dv{t}v_\mathrm{car}.
\end{equation}
But because all measurements are discrete, numerical differentiation e.g. forward difference must be used
\begin{equation}
	a_\mathrm{car}(h) = \frac{v_\mathrm{car}(x + h) - v_\mathrm{car}(x)}{h}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	a_\mathrm{car, t} = \frac{v_\mathrm{car, t + 1} - v_\mathrm{car, t}}{T}
\end{equation}
with $h$ being the step size, which depends on the rate of the sensor.

\subsubsection{Gravity method}
\label{subsubsec:gravity_method}
As described in \cref{ssec:linear_acceleration_only}, the linear acceleration measurements can be used to determine the pitch angle.
But the estimation is only valid under the condition, that there are no accelerations other than the acceleration due to gravity.
This condition is not necessarily true when the car is driving, during which the car can accelerate or brake.
To get the correct estimation, the car's acceleration must be subtracted from the measurement.
The car's acceleration can be calculated by deriving the car's velocity, calculated from the wheel speed measurements, with respect to time.
It is important that both the \gls{imu} and odometer measurements are synchronized in time.
The prevailing accelerations during a positive acceleration can be seen in \cref{fig:tikz_car_gravity}.
When the car brakes, the direction of $\vb{a}_\mathrm{x}$ inverts.
The car pitch angle calculation is the same as in \cref{eq:ang_from_acc}, just that now the car acceleration $\vb{a}_\mathrm{at}$ is taken into account.
\begin{equation}
	\alpha = \arcsin\left(\frac{\vb{a}_\mathrm{x} - \vb{a}_\mathrm{at}}{\norm{\vb{g}}}\right)
	= \arcsin\left(\frac{\vb{a}_\mathrm{x} - \dv{t}v_\mathrm{at} }{\norm{\vb{g}}}\right)
\end{equation}
with $\vb{a}_\mathrm{x}$ being the acceleration measured by the x-axis of the \gls{imu} and $\norm{\vb{g}}$ being the magnitude of the overall measured acceleration.
