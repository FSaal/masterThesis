For the experiments the myAHRS+, a low cost high performance \gls{ahrs} will be used.
An AHRS contains an IMU and outputs the raw data but also has an integrated Kalman filter which calculates the pose in form of quaternion or euler angles.
It offers an micro-USB interface and runs with up to \SI{100}{\Hz}.
It can capture a change of $\pm$2000 dps (degrees per second), $\pm$16 $g$ and $\pm$\SI{1200}{\micro\tesla}.
During the experiment only a fraction of this range is expected to be reached, hence the sensor seems suitable.
Besides the hardware the unit already has an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) on board.
The EKF fuses the measurements of the three sensors and estimates a quaternion (and sth else?) from it.
But this will not be used.

\subsection{Lidar}
Two different LiDARs will be used during the experiment.
The RS-Bpearl and the Velodyne UltraPuck.
The most relevant data can be seen in table \ref{tab:lidar_datasheets}.
Both are mechanical LiDARs and have the same number of laser channels, but the Velodyne has a significant better vertical resolution, due to the smaller vertical FOV.

%\subsubsection{Mechanical}
%One of the earliest realization of a gyroscope and consists of a platform and three (or two?!) gimbals.  
%\subsection{Optical}
%More precise but also more expensive are optical gyroscopes. It uses the signac effect, which says that it takes longer to travel a circular path with the direction of rotation, than it does against. A coil of optical fiber with multiple loops is setup and a laser beam is sent in both directions and the interference of the two beams is measured. Due to the high speed of light the path has to be long enough (>\SI{100}{\metre}), to allow for a measurable result.
