\section{Evaluation concept}
\todoin{\begin{itemize}
    \item Explaination of scores etc
    \item Taking average for multiple ramps but also one single ramp
\end{itemize}}



\section{Ramp metering? (IMU)}
\todoin{\begin{itemize}
    \item How well do different IMU methods work...
    \item ... at ramp detection
    \item ... at ramp distance measuring
    \item ... at angle estimation
\end{itemize}}



\section{Ramp detection (Lidar and camera)}
\todoin{\begin{itemize}
    \item Confusion matrix or similar (false negatives could be hard (e.g. curve))
    \item Estimated angle and distance compare to ground truth
    \item Do downwards ramp work?
    \item Camera Lidar projection for nice visualization
    \item Something about camera
\end{itemize}}
