\section{Motivation}
Parking is one of the most challenging driving tasks and the cause of almost half of the car accidents~\cite{accident2015}.
Current premium cars are already able to park on their own in sufficiently big parallel or perpendicular parking spaces.
But due to the very limited space in cities, multi-storey parking garages are often used in central areas~\cite{Khalid2021}.
Navigating through a parking garage is a challenging task for an inexperienced driver, due to the tight turns and limited space.
Recent advantages in the field of autonomous driving try to make the life of the driver easier.

One of the most promising applications of autonomous driving is the \gls{avp}.
\gls{avp} allows for a fully automated parking experience.
The car is left in a drop-off zone and finds a parking spot on its own.
Afterwards the driver can give a command and the car leaves the parking spot again and picks up the driver.
\gls{avp} saves time, the hassle of remembering the parking level and spot and also minimizes the risk of collisions.
Furthermore, it allows for a more efficient use of the parking space, since no space for the opening of the doors is needed.
\gls{avp} has the potential to become one of the first fully automated driving task, due to the closed environment, low speeds and the possibility to equip the environment with additional sensors~\cite{Banzhaf2017}.

But to autonomously navigate an exact mapping of the environment and localization of the car is necessary.
This can be done either by \gls{slam} or the area can be mapped beforehand, in which case only a localization of the car is necessary.
While the mapping of the environment can be done in 3D, the localization is usually done in 2D and a change of levels would thus not be detected.
Hence, if the car is driven up or down a ramp, the new map of the corresponding floor has to be loaded.
To solve this problem, a ramp detection has to be implemented.
Furthermore, the ramp detection can be used to increase or reduce the motor output of the vehicle, if it is nearing a ramp going up or down respectively.
Another potential use of the detection algorithm is for the creation of a semantic map of the environment.
In this map, areas are classified in different classes, e.g. ground, obstacle or ramp \cite{Sakenas2007}.
The properties of the ramp could also be stored and used to adapt the speed of the vehicle accordingly.



\section{Goals}
The goal of this thesis is the development of a ramp detection system.
The system should be able to detect the presence of a ramp and estimate the distance of the car to the ramp.
The detection should work with minimal delay and should be able to handle different types of ramps.
Furthermore, ramp properties such as the slope, width and the length of the ramp should be estimated.
Different sensors and methods will be used and compared to each other.
An \gls{imu} will be used to detect if the car is currently on a ramp and to measure the ramp properties.
A \gls{lidar} and a camera will be used to detect a ramp before entering it and the \gls{lidar} will also be used to estimate the distance to the ramp and other ramp properties.
To evaluate the system, experiments in a real world scenario are conducted.
The tests are performed in a parking garage with different types of ramps.
