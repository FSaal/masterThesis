Ramps in parking garages are challenging
In this thesis a ramp detection system is developed.
Three different sensors are used and compared to each other.
An \gls{imu} is used to measure the road grade and to determine if the car is on a ramp.
Different methods are tested and compared, including one where the wheel speed sensor measurements are fused with the \gls{imu} data.
To determine if the car is approaching a ramp, a \gls{lidar} sensor and a camera are used.
Using the \gls{lidar} data, the distance to the ramp and properties of the ramp, such as the angle, width and length can be determined.
The detection using the camera is based on the Mask \gls{rcnn}.
An own dataset is created for the training of the network.
The performance and accuracy of the different sensors and methods are evaluated in a real life scenario.
